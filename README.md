<p align="center"><b>open tenancy legal decision trees.</p></b>

We need help writing up decision trees to get our open source access to justice project off the ground. The long story short is that we are targetting primarily students, but also those with tenancy issues in the UK. We want to create a simple questionnaire, that they can then walk away with a document listing their tenancy rights at the end.

Keen to help? Awesome! What we need is help figuring out the relevant questions to be asking: which is where you come in. 

You can find a list of our current topics that we need decision trees for [here](topics.md). We've also included an example of our electricity decision tree [here](/decisiontrees/electric.txt). 

## what to write? 
We understand that you may not have legal experience, or extensive experience with tenancy rights - that's fine (someone with legal experience will check all submissions to verify their validity, and we will make it clear that this is not legally binding advice). If a topic is too large, break it down in to a simple yes or no route that you would ask someone to get to the bottom of their problem based on that topic. Just let us know when you submit the aspects of that topic that you didn't cover, and we can expand on that! 

We'd prefer them to be in the style of a decision tree, which is something like this: 

``` 
question: are you feeling good today? 
  yes: that's good that you're feeling good! are you excited for the weekend? 
    yes: yay glad to hear you're excited for the weekend! do you have any plans? 
      no: that's cool time to relax! END OF INTERVIEW
      yes: awesome enjoy! END OF INTERVIEW
    no: oh no that sucks that you aren't excited for the weekend :(
  no: why don't you feel good today? 
```

Obviously they will get a bit more complex, but make them as complex as you feel comfortable with - we can do the rest, or open it up for further submissions who can build on your work! 

You do not have to make them full, gramatically correct, questions if you're strapped for time - a few notes that we can expand on would be brilliant. 

Make sure you note where the interview ends (ie where you give them the final tenancy advice; whether that is to talk to their landlord, contact the local council, file a complaint, etc. - that way we know where to generate the document). 

## useful resources 

here are a few useful, accurate, resources to identify the relevant law: 
* [citizens advice](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/)
* [tenants voice](https://www.thetenantsvoice.co.uk/advice_from_us/tenants-rights/)
* [gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/private-renting)
* [legislation & statues](https://www.legislation.gov.uk)

## how to submit? 

We'd prefer if you did it through Github. You will need to make an account, fork our repository, create a branch, commit your file to the decision trees folder, and then review and submit it to our repository - that way we can then approve it once verified and add it directly to this page for one of our coders to input to our questionnaire! A really handy tutorial is available at [this repository](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions), although they are really clear if you're struggling with some of the steps shoot us an email at owner.opentenancy@gmail.com. A big benefit of submitting through Github is that you will be listed on our list of contributors for the project!!

However, if that's a bit tricky for you feel free to send it as an email to owner.opentenancy@gmail.com. 

You can upload them in a .txt file, .pdf, .docx, .md or any format that you prefer! As long as it is clear. 

## what do you get out of it? 

If you upload to our Github - you will be listed as an official contributor! We will post on our linkedIn, twitter, and instagram when we upload - and refer to our many amazing contributors who helped made this possible. Being open source means we're helping break the barriers of the legal system, and ensure that everyone is able to enforce their rights!
